        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <hr width="700">
        <p2>Nonprofit animal rescue websites need to clearly translate their passion and inspire users to do three things: 
            <br>
            <br>
            1. Adopt
            <br>
            2. Volunteer/Foster
            <br>
            3. Donate
            <br>
            <br>
            We have observed Rabbit Advocate’s website to be difficult to navigate across all devices with an overall, outdated aesthetic. As a result, Rabbit Advocates is not able to provide users with a seamless accessible experience inspiring and allowing them to easily navigate adoption, volunteering and donation. 
        </p2>

     <!-- User Research -->
     <section class="caseStudybody">
     <h2>The Solution</h2>
     <hr width="700">
     <h3>Research Plan</h3>
     <p2>We created a research plan to define the following: 
        <br>
        <br>
        What information a user is looking for when adopting a pet?
        <br>
        What would hinder the adoption process?
        <br>
        What are some pain points that users have experienced in past adoptions?
        <br>
        <br>
        The approach we took to uncover this information: 
        <br>
        <br>
        User Surveys - 12 Users
        <br>
        1-1 Informational Interviews - 6 Users who had previously adopted animals
        <br>
	    2 Users had previously adopted through Rabbit Advocates 

    </p2>
     <h3>Proto Persona</h3>
     <p2>We began our user research by creating a proto persona to define our target user. Bethany Williams is a cashier in her late 20’s that is in love with the idea of adopting a rabbit companion. Bethany is nervous to go through the adoption process, overwhelmed with the amount of rabbits available and needs guidance on rabbit care.</p2>
     <img src=>
     <h3>User Surveys</h3>
     <p2>12 Users were surveyed. Some of the most compelling results we received were about the importance of an animal rescue’s online presence. A majority of users preferred to find their ideal adoptable pet online.</p2>
     <h3>User Interviews</h3>
     <p2>We completed 1-1 interviews over Zoom with 6 users that have previously adopted pets. 2 of the users had adopted from Rabbit Advocates and were able to highlight some of their pain points when going through the online adoption process. Interviews were recorded and transcribed using AWS. Insights from each interview were transcribed on post-it notes and sorted into an affinity diagram using Miro to help highlight the most common themes and further define the areas we needed to focus on for this redesign.
         <br>
         <strong>Key Findings:</strong>
         <br>
        Using Petfinder as a plugin allows rescues to easily input animal information without having to be too tech savvy. 
        <br>
        It is important to users that rescues have an online presence and their websites need to look legitimate. 
        <br>
        The adoption application was incredibly long and made users question the adoption process. 
     </p2>
     <h3>Heuristic Analysis</h3>
     <p2>To ensure that we clearly understood the Rabbit Advocates’ adoption process, we completed a heuristic analysis of the existing adoption flow website pages.</p2>
    <p2>Home Page:
        <br>
        Outdated aesthetic
        <br>
        Unclear navigation
        <br>
        Passion for work needs to be more clearly translated
    </p2> 
    <p2> Available Rabbits Page:
        <br>
        Outdated aesthetic
        <br>
        Uses Petfinder plugin for ease of use
        <br>
        Ability to filter available rabbits
    </p2>
    <p2>Adoption Process Page:
        <br>
        Outdated aesthetic
        <br>
        Outlines the adoption requirements but not the process
        <br>
        Has a lot of great information but low skim value
    </p2>

    <section class="caseStudybody">
    <h2>Definition & Ideation</h2>
    <hr width="700">
    <h3>User Flow</h3>
    <p2>Through our interviews, the number one pain point called out multiple times by users was the adoption process. We decided that the first flow we would focus on improving was the adoption flow. Starting with the Homepage of the website and ending at the User's Profile page awaiting their adoption application approval.</p2>
    <h3>Empathy Map</h3>
    <p2>We distilled our interview highlights into an empathy map to clearly articulate our user’s needs. As we found, users felt the adoption application was extremely long and were blindsided by the process. While we can’t change the adoption process or requirements, we can increase the transparency of process and information as to why it is so intensive.</p2>
    <h3>Industry Analysis</h3>
    <p2>We researched the websites of other rabbit rescue groups and a few other nonprofits. The most impressive websites that we analyzed had approachable, professional designs which increased the credibility of the organization and value to the user. </p2>
    <h3>I Like, I Wish, What If?</h3>
    <p2>With the best features of the analyzed websites in mind, we did the “I Like, I Wish, What If?” exercise to capture all of the existing features we liked and wanted to keep, features we wanted to improve and features we wanted to add. We then organized all of the ideas into a priority matrix to assess the features that would have the largest impact to users. </p2>
    <h3>Journey Map</h3>
    <p2>Now that we had focused down to a user flow, identified our user and their needs and pinpointed the features we wanted to move forward with, we needed to create a journey map that outlined the experience and emotions that our user would go through during the online adoption process. </p2>
    <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
    <p2>To address the navigation issues that the website was facing, we performed a card sorting exercise to reorganize the categories on the navigation bar, footer and include new calls to action.
        <br>
        Key Navigation Updates:
        <br>
        Update order of categories in main navigation bar 
        <br>
        Create upper global navigation bar
        <br>
        Create call to action “adoption” button clearly 
        <br>
        Put more emphasis on “donation” across every page of website
        <br>
        Card sorting was then performed on the adoption application due to the large amount of questions. It was important to keep all of the existing questions as they are required by the rescue and instead, sort them into digestible chunks allowing the user to see their progress and create a less intimidating process.

    <!-- Wireframing -->
    <section class="caseStudybody">
    <h2>Wireframing</h2>
    <hr width="700">
    <p2>Now that we had a finalized sitemap, we were able to begin wireframing out what the basic layout of our adoption flow would be. We used a mobile first approach on this project to ensure that our design would work across all types of devices. User testing was completed using a clickable prototype (created in InVision).</p2>

    <!-- Midfidelity Prototyping -->
    <section class="caseStudybody">
    <h2>Mid Fidelity Prototyping</h2>
    <hr width="700">
    <p2>The user testing performed on the low fidelity prototype informed the design and features created on a new, mid fidelity prototype. We focused on creating more interest throughout the application process by adding illustrations and process updates. To give users a sense of completion, we also added a “Continue” button at the end of each section instead of one continuous scrolling form. As with the low fidelity prototype, user testing was completed on the mid fidelity prototype to inform the high fidelity prototype.</p2>

    <!-- Visual Direction -->
    <section class="caseStudybody">
    <h2>Creating The Visual Direction</h2>
    <hr width="700">
    <h3>Mood Board</h3>
    <p2>Before we could go from low fidelity prototypes to mid fidelity, we needed to finalize a new logo, color palette, UI patterns and overall look and feel of our website. </p2>
    <h3>Brand Assets</h3>
    <p2>After deciding upon the look and feel and iterating through many fonts and logo options, we landed on the following brand assets to use across our website. </p2>

    <!-- Next Steps -->
    <section class="caseStudybody">
    <h2>Next Steps & Learnings</h2>
    <hr width="700">
    <p2>With more time, we would like to have been able to contact and interview a representative from Rabbit Advocates to get more insight into their needs and feedback on our designs. We would also like to continue to build out the rest of the pages across the website and add more brand presence across the website. 
        <br>
        Our learnings were as follows: 
        <br>
        It is imperative that nonprofits have a strong online presence and clearly translate the passion they have for their work through their website.
        <br>
        While an intensive process can ensure that less than serious users are weeded out, a lack of transparency on the process can create major barriers for users.
        <br>
        When redesigning a website like this one that needs extensive updates, breaking down your redesign work into specific flows makes the work a lot more achievable.
